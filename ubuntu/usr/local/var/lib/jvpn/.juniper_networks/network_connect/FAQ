Q: JVPN is not working for me
A: Try to enable debug output. You will find logs in the 
   ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ directory. Also you can try ncui mode.

Q: Is it possible to run it non non ARM/MIPS/PPC?
A: No, because it using closing source VPN client binary available only for
   i386 platform.

Q: Where to send patches?
A: Use "pull request" at https://github.com/samm-git/jvpn/. Or just by mail.

Q: Could you help me with my VPN account, it does not work?
A: Only if you can provide credentials to test. I need them to debug 
   connection from native GUI and JVPN to identify what is going wrong.
   Also you can try to debug yourself. Some tools i used:
    * Wireshark/tcpdump - to dump traffic between ncsvc and JAVA GUI
    * strace - to trace VPN processes
    * Java decompiler - to decompile source code of GUI, not too much 
      interesting, anyway

Q: Is it possible to use jvpn on FreeBSD?
A: No. FreeBSD supports Linux ABI, but ncsvc heavily depends on Linux network
   stack, including /proc/net/route, /proc/net/tun, etc. It _should_ be
   possible to emulate all this staff or to use LD_PRELOAD hacks, but it will
   require much more efforts.

Q: What if I get status=6e and Authentication failed
A: Check, where is your ifconfig binary. It should be at /sbin/ifconfig
